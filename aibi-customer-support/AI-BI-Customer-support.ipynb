    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s competitive environment, ensuring top-notch customer support is essential for retaining clients and fostering loyalty. Inefficient support team management can lead to slower response times, unresolved customer issues, and a negative impact on customer satisfaction and brand reputation. Organizations without a robust data intelligence platform often face challenges in consolidating data from multiple channels, providing actionable insights to support teams, and minimizing the time required to address customer concerns effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks' Intelligence Platform leverages **AI and Business Intelligence (AI/BI)** to transform the way organizations manage and analyze customer support operations. By integrating data from support ticketing systems, CRM platforms, and customer feedback channels into a unified environment, Databricks eliminates data silos and provides complete visibility into support team performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced AI-driven analytics and intuitive BI tools enable support managers and agents to monitor key metrics such as response time, resolution rate, and customer satisfaction. With natural language query capabilities, users can easily identify bottlenecks, uncover trends, and optimize workflows. This approach accelerates time-to-insights, improves team efficiency, and ensures a consistently high level of service for customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the following sections, this notebook will guide you at a high level through:\n",
    "1. Data Ingestion with **Lakeflow Connect**\n",
    "2. Data Governance and Security with **Unity Catalog**\n",
    "3. Creating Interactive **Dashboards** with Databricks\n",
